# **Remote World List**
This prefab allows you to remotely edit your World/Portal Lists using a website like Pastebin to host the list on.

## **How to set this Prefab up in your world**
To set up this prefab, use Pastebin to host the list it is whitelisted by VRChat, so it works regardless if Untrusted URLs are turned on.
It is recommended to leave the paste visibility on Unlisted, but Public works just as fine. You cannot use Private for visibility.
After creating your pastes, get the "Raw" version's URL and put it into the script. The Raw link will look something like this: https://pastebin.com/raw/xxxxxxx

To properly set up the list, format the list like this:

World ID

Each new line is one world link. So per world is one line.

When adding/removing slots, make sure you align your portals in order. Start from left to right for best results.
