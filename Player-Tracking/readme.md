# Player Tracking Scripts

Various scripts for following the player or a part of them.
The Unity Package included in this directory contains all the scripts mentioned below.

## Follow Head
The object the script is attached to (or a specific object to override) will follow the player's head.
This is used in the **Announcement System** prefab I made, and is included with it.

TODO: Add Options to disable rotation and position tracking, perhaps?
